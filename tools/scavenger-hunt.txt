Note: This is being done on a mac computer
1.
    ipconfig getifaddr en0 (this is for wireless connections, if I was using a wired connection as well,
    I could use the same command but en1 instead of en0)
2.
    nslookup HOSTNAME
3.
    nslookup IPADDRESS
4.
    scp LOCALFILEPATH DESTINATION (and enter passwords if prompted)
    (For me this was scp /Users/Eric\ 1/Desktop/Cybersecurity/cs231/tools/scavenger-hunt.txt 
    neidharte@mirage.mathcs.carleton.edu:~/Desktop)
5.
    nc -z IPADDRESS PORTNUMBER
6.
    nc -z IPADDRESS STARTOFPORTRANGE-ENDOFPORTRANGE (1-10000 should cover all important ports)
7.
    curl "URL" >> DESINATIONFILEPATH
8.
    curl -I URL
9.
