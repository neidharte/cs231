I'll be using Remote Labs for the Kali installation (using a non-M1 chip mac, but had unspecified 'kernel issues' when trying to setup VirtualBox).
One issue I had was once I tried to make the Kali window go full screen, and it sort of locked me out of my desktop screen, and I had to do a full computer
restart to fix the issue, since I couldn't even close the window.
